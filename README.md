  <!-- # Added 3 project features :

## Loaders :
Loaders are a powerful new feature in React Router that can help you improve the performance and user experience of your applications. To use a loader, you simply need to define a loader function for the route. The loader function will be called when the route is navigated, and it should return a Promise that resolves to the data that you want to load. Once the Promise resolves, the data will be made available to the component that is associated with the route.

 ## LocalStorage :
The localStorage feature allows you to store data on the client side that is persistent, meaning that it is not deleted when the browser is closed. This is useful for storing data that needs to be accessed across multiple sessions, such as user preferences or login information. The localStorage feature is used to store the donation information of the user. This means that the user can donate to multiple projects without having to enter their information each time. The next time the user visits the website, their donation information will be pre-populated.
 ##### Persistent data storage: 
Data stored in localStorage is not deleted when the browser is closed.
##### Client-side storage:
 Data stored in localStorage is stored on the client side, which means that it is not accessible to the server. This can improve privacy and security.
 ##### Large storage capacity:
 localStorage can store up to 5MB of data.
Fast performance: localStorage is very fast, as it does not require any network communication.

## useState Hook :

The useState hook allows you to manage state in your React components. State is data that is specific to a component and can be changed over time.

The useState hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state value.

##### Simplified development:
 useState hooks make it easy to perform side effects and manage state in your React components. This can simplify the development process and make your code more readable and maintainable.
##### Improved performance: 
The useEffect hook can be used to optimize the performance of your React applications by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
##### Increased flexibility: 
The useState hook allows you to manage state in a flexible way. You can use it to store any type of data, and you can update the state value at any time. -->
